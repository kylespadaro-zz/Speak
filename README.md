# Speak

Speak is a simple TTS client I have been working on. If you don't know what TTS is,
it is when you type something into your device, and your device speaks it.

Written in Swift for iOS using Xcode 7.
This app is optimized for iOS 9, but it could run on iOS 7 / iOS 8 if it needs to.


TO ANYBODY WHO DOWNLOADS:
Please do not upload it to the app store.
I made this app, I deserve some credit, even if I haven't finished it yet.
