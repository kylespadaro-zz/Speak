# Speak

Speak is a simple TTS client I have been working on. If you don't know what TTS is,
it is when you type something into your device, and your device speaks it.

Written in Swift for iOS using Xcode 7.
This app is optimized for iOS 9, but it also is able to run on iOS 7 / iOS 8, it has been tested before.
